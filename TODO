### Codebase Cleanup Report

Items are ordered by importance, considering impact on maintainability, bug potential, performance, and security. Risks are assessed as low (minimal chance of breaking functionality), medium (potential for subtle issues), or high (could disrupt core features).

#### 1. **Remove Debug Print Statements in Production Code** (High Importance - Maintainability/Bug Prevention)
   - **Description**: Multiple transcribers (granite.py, faster_whisper.py, openai_whisper.py) contain extensive DEBUG print statements in `preload_models` and `ensure_models_available` methods (e.g., logging HF_HUB_OFFLINE, HF_HOME, HF_TOKEN). These are leftover from development and clutter production output. Speaker_namer.py also has interactive prints that could be logged instead.
   - **Files Affected**: `local_transcribe/providers/transcribers/granite.py` (lines ~65-85), `faster_whisper.py` (lines ~100-110), `openai_whisper.py` (lines ~55-75), `lib/speaker_namer.py` (multiple lines).
   - **Risk**: Low - Removing prints won't affect functionality; replace with proper logging if needed.

#### 2. **Refactor Duplicate Interactive Selection Logic in CLI** (High Importance - Maintainability)
   - **Description**: The `interactive_prompt` function in `cli.py` (353 lines) contains repetitive while loops for selecting providers (transcriber, aligner, diarization, etc.). Each follows the same pattern: print options, read int input, validate, handle errors. This violates DRY and makes the file hard to maintain.
   - **Files Affected**: `local_transcribe/framework/cli.py` (lines ~40-300).
   - **Risk**: Medium - Refactoring into a helper function could introduce input validation bugs if not tested thoroughly.

#### 3. **Extract Duplicate `get_available_models` Implementations** (Medium Importance - Maintainability)
   - **Description**: Many providers implement `get_available_models` identically as `return list(self.model_mapping.keys())` (e.g., mlx_whisper, granite, faster_whisper, openai_whisper). Others hardcode lists. This can be standardized or abstracted.
   - **Files Affected**: `local_transcribe/providers/transcribers/*.py`, `aligners/*.py`, `unified/*.py`.
   - **Risk**: Low - Abstracting to a base class method or utility function is safe and backward-compatible.

#### 4. **Break Down Long Functions into Smaller Units** (Medium Importance - Readability/Maintainability)
   - **Description**: `interactive_prompt` in `cli.py` (250+ lines) and `run_pipeline` in `pipeline_runner.py` (300+ lines) are monolithic. They handle multiple concerns (input validation, provider setup, mode detection) and should be split into sub-functions for better testability and readability.
   - **Files Affected**: `local_transcribe/framework/cli.py`, `pipeline_runner.py`.
   - **Risk**: Medium - Splitting could change call signatures or introduce subtle logic errors if dependencies aren't handled carefully.

#### 5. **Audit and Remove Unused Imports or Code** (Medium Importance - Performance/Maintainability)
   - **Description**: No missing imports detected via Pylance, but potential unused code exists (e.g., debug utilities in `.debug_utils/`, redundant model mapping logic). Some providers may have unused methods from the base class. The codebase has no TODO/FIXME comments, which is good.
   - **Files Affected**: Various (e.g., check `providers/` for overridden but unused base methods).
   - **Risk**: Low - Removing unused code is safe; use static analysis tools to confirm.

#### 6. **Standardize Error Handling and Logging** (Low Importance - Consistency)
   - **Description**: Inconsistent error handling (some use print, others raise exceptions). Logging is configured but not uniformly used (e.g., progress.py uses Rich console, others use print).
   - **Files Affected**: Throughout (e.g., `lib/logging_config.py` exists but isn't used everywhere).
   - **Risk**: Low - Gradual migration to logging won't break functionality.

#### 7. **Review Plugin Architecture for Tight Coupling** (Low Importance - Scalability)
   - **Description**: The plugin system is solid, but some providers have tight coupling (e.g., shared model mappings). No circular imports detected, but ensure interfaces are strictly followed.
   - **Files Affected**: `framework/plugin_interfaces.py`, `providers/`.
   - **Risk**: Low - Minor refactoring for better abstraction.
